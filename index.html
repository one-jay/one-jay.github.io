        <h3>Loops</h3>
          <h4>while</h4>
          <p>
            The while loop performs its statement while its conditions 
            remain true. When the program encounters the loop, it evaluates 
            if the condition is true, and if so, it executes the statement, and then 
            checks again if the condition is true. This process repeats itself 
            until the condition is not true, at which point the program 
            continues on after the while loop. A common pattern with the 
            while loop is to have a number variable that increments with each 
            loop, so that the loop is limited from running indefinitely. 
          </p>
          <h4>do while</h4>
          <p>
            do while is similar to while, except that the code block to execute 
            comes before the while condition, and is therefor guaranteed to be executed 
            at least once. The code in the do block is executed, and then if the 
            while condition is true, executed again repeatedly until the condition 
            is no longer true, at which point it executes any code within 
            the while statement's braces, and then continues on with the rest of the program. 
          </p>
          <h4>for</h4>
          <p>
            Since, with most while loops a variable is used to increment through 
            loops, the for loop is an alternate syntax that may be more concise 
            and convenient. In it, the variable to increment with is instantiated 
            first, then the condition to continue looping is defined, followed by the 
            rule to increment by. So when the program reaches a for loop, 
            it first assigns a value to the variable to increment , then checks if 
            the condition to run is true, and if so, executes the statements within 
            the for loop's braces, and then increments the variable to increment accordingly. 
            Note, the declarations in the the for loop can also be placed elsewhere, such as placing 
            the variable to increment before the loop, or the value to increment by within the loop, and 
            it will run the same, in that case very much like a while loop. 
          </p>
          <h4>for in</h4>
          <p>
            The for in loop is a type of for each loop, in which you can 
            loop through each of the properties of an object. 
          </p>
          <h4>for of</h4>
          <p>for of is similar to for in, except instead of looping through 
            object properties, it loops through elements in an array, or 
            chars in a string. 
          </p>
          <h4>forEach</h4>
          <p>
            I was originally planning to cover this in JS Arrays, but decided to cover it 
            here instead. With any array (which in itself is an object), you can use the 
            method forEach(), and for each element in the array, pass it to 
            a function to act upon. 
          </p>

        <h3>Conditionals</h3>
        <h4>Boolean</h4>
          <p>I wanted to touch on booleans before getting into the rest 
            of the conditionals, since they all hinge on this principle 
            of true vs false. Why the name Boolean? It is derived from 
            the work of English mathematician George Boole (1815-1864).
          </p>
        <h4>if</h4>
          <p>The if statement evaluates an expression, and if the 
            expression evalueates to true, the code following is executed, 
            otherwise, the program continues on without executing the code 
            immediately following the if statement. 
          </p>
        <h4>else</h4>
          <p>The else statement can be used after an if statement 
            to execute some code if the if's condition was not true
          </p>
        <h4>ternary</h4>
          <p>The ternary, or conditional, operator is a more concise 
            syntax when you simply need to return one value if an expression is true 
            or another of an expression is false. It works very much like 
            the if formula in excel. It is called ternary, because it is 
            composed of three operands. The syntax begins with the expression to be 
            evaluated, followed by a ?, followed by the expression to be returned if true, 
            followed by a :, followed by the expression to be returned if false. 
            For example, expressionToEvaluate ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
          </p>
        <h4>else if</h4>
          <p>else if can also be used after an if statement if you want 
            to evaluate another expression after the previous statement 
            evaluated to false. An if statement can be followed by as many 
            else if statements as you would like, but when each statement is 
            comparing against the same expression, a switch statement may be 
            a better solution. 
          </p>
        <h4>switch</h4>
          <p>The switch statement allows a single expression to be evaluated 
            in many ways, and depending on its evaluation, one of many statements 
            can be executed. The syntax begins with the switch keyword, followed by 
            the expression to be evaluated in paranthesis, and then within curly braces 
            a series of case statements, with each case statement beginning with the 
            case keyword, followed by a value that the expression may evaluate to, 
            followed by a :, and then the code to be executed. 
            Note, it is also common to utilize a break statement, unless it is intended 
            that multiple case statements may be executed for a single expression. 
          </p>

        <h3>Functions & Parameters</h3>
        <p>
          functions in javascript are a useful way to reuse code and make your code more dynamic. 
          Reuseable in the sense that a block of code can be called from many different 
          places in the program, rather than having to rewrite the same functionality multiple times, 
          and dynamic in that they can take parameters, or different inputs, each time they are 
          called, to produce different results. 
        </p>
        <p>
          functions can be declared normally, using the function keyword, followed by the name of the function, 
          followed by a set of (parenthesis), followed by the statements {within curly braces}. 
          Inside the () may be one or more parameters, which are values passed into the function 
          for use with the function statements. The value received through the parameter is called the 
          argument(s). 
        </p>
        <p>With ES6, there is also a new way of declaring simple functions called 
          arrow functions, as is descriptive of their simplified syntax. Arrow functions do 
          not have a name (per se), but can be assigned to a variable name for easy access. 
          Their syntax is made up of the (parenthesis), which may include one or more parameters, 
          followed by the arrow =>, followed by the expression to be returned. The return keyword 
          is not needed, and neither are the {curly braces}. This syntax makes it very simple to 
          define simple functions, but this method does also have some drawbacks to consider. 
          With arrow functions, you can only execute one statement, and they also have 
          a different way of handling the this keyword. With regular functions, this refers to 
          the object that called the function, but with arrow functions, this refers to the object that 
          owns the function, or the object in which the arrow function is declared. 
        </p>

        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <p>
          variables provide a way to store data in memory for a program, 
            and there are many ways to store data with javascript. 
            Javascript is an untyped language, which means that when a 
            variable is declared, it can be of any type of data, without 
            defining the data type, and further, that the type of data 
            assigned to a variable can change throughout the course of the program 
            (with a few exceptions). </p>
          <p> The first step, before a value can be stored 
            to a variable is to declare the variable, but defining a name for the variable. 
            Variable names can be named anything, and javascript is case sensitive, 
            but they must start with a letter (or _ or $), and may only contain 
            letters, numbers (and _ or $). Once the variable name is declared, 
            then the variable can be initialized, by using the = (assignment operator) 
            to set its value. </p>
          <p> The value assigned to a variable can be 
            a primitive value, like a boolean (true/false) value, a number, a string 
            (strings must be set within quotes (single or double quotes)), 
            an object (objects must be assigned using {curly braces}), an array 
            (arrays must be assigned using [square braces]), a function, or null. If a variable 
            is declared but not initialized, its value is undefined. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Variables can be declared in a number of ways, and 
          depending on where it is declared and the keyword used to 
          declare it makes a big difference in its availability and 
          where it can be used, i.e. scope. 
        </p>
        <h4>global scope</h4>
        <p>variables declared outside of any function are assigned with global scope, meaning 
          they can be accessed from anywhere within the program. 
        </p>
        <h4>var</h4>
        <p>declaring a variable with the keyword var gives it gives it function 
          scope, if it is declared within a function, or global scope if it is 
          declared outside of any function. If it is declared within a function
          (even within a nested block scope, i.e. for{}, if{}, etc.), 
          it can be used anywhere within that function, and any nested functions 
          or block scopes, but not outside of the function in which it was declared. 
        </p>
        <h4>let</h4>
        <p>let is a new keyword with ES6 (ECMAScript (Javascript) 2015), 
          and it allows for block scope specifically, meaning that a variable 
          declared with let is unique to the {block scope} it is declared within 
          and cannot be used anywhere else in the function or program. 
        </p>
        <h4>const</h4>
        <p>const is another new keyword with ES6, and while it shares 
          the same scope rules as let, it does so in a way so that its value cannot 
          be overwritten with another assignment (though there are some exceptions to 
          this, such as that individual elements of const arrays, or individual properties 
          of const objects can be updated).
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h3>Arrays & Associative Arrays</h3>
        <p>
          An array is a list of values. Values in arrays can be primitive, or objects. 
          Arrays are declared by assigning a list of comma separated values within [square brackets] to a variable. 
          The values of an array do not need to be of the same data type, meaning 
          you could have an array like this: let myArray = [true, 'or', false, 69, "is my", {favorite: 'number'}]
        </p>
        <p>
          Associative Arrays are not really a thing in javascript. 
          An associative array is an array in which elements are referred to by their name. 
          In javascript, object properties can be referred to by name, but 
          elements in an array are always referred to by their index number.

      <h2>JSON</h2>
      <p>JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is 
        simply a pattern for formatting text strings and files in 
        a way that similarly matches the syntax used for defining an 
        object in javascript. 
      </p>
      <p>In javascript, as with JSON, an object is declared within {curly braces}. 
        Objects then have properties, and each property has a value. 
        The name in each key value pair must be within "double quotes". 
        Data types that can be assigned to properties in JSON include boolean values (true/false, no quotes),
        numbers (with or without decimals, no quotes), and strings (surrounded by "quotes"). 
        Just as javascript can have objects nested within objects, so can JSON. 
        And just as with javascript, JSON can have arrays of values assigned 
        to a property, using comma separated values within [square brackets]. 

      </p>
      <div>
        <h3>Parse</h3>
        <p>the JSON object in javascript has a method called parse, which 
          takes a json formatted string (or text file), and assigns the data 
          to an object (variable) in the javascript program running. 
        </p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Stringify</h3>
        <p>
          The JSON object in javascript also has a method called stringify, 
          which essentially does the opposite of parse, taking a variable 
          with an object assigned to it, and then returning a string in json format 
          that matches the data structure of the object that it received.

      <h2>AJAX</h2>
      <div>
        <p>AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML, but in practicality 
          it really just means asynchronous javascript, since XML is quite optional and 
          rarely used, with JSON being preferred instead. Asynchronous javascript means 
          that javascript can request data from external sources and web services 
          and continue on with its operations without waiting for the external source to respond. 
          When the request is responded to and received, javascript can then react to it, 
          updating the page without reload. 
        </p>
        <h3>XMLHTTPRequest</h3>
        <p>
          XMLHTTPRequest is a standard object in javascript for requesting 
          data asynchronously. To use it, create an instance of that object with the new keyword and 
          store it in a variable. Then use the open() method and pass in the appropriate parameters, 
          being first, the HTTP verb to use to make the request, such as GET or POST, and 
          secondly, the resource being requested, which could be a local / relative path, or 
          an external resource referenced by absolute path or URL.

      <div>
        <h3>Manipulating CSS Class Properties Using JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          Javascript can also be used to update the class property on an html element. 
          In the example below, there is an html input element of type checkbox. 
          When the checkbox is checked, it calls a javascript function which 
          updates the class name of the div. When the class name is updated, 
          the css rules of that class are applied to the div element, 
          in which case the div begins animating in a continuous cycle,

        <h3>Creating CSS3 Transitions and Animations in CSS and triggering them with JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
          Javascript can also be used to update the class property on an html element. 
          In the example below, there is an html input element of type checkbox. 
          When the checkbox is checked, it calls a javascript function which 
          updates the class name of the div. When the class name is updated, 
          the css rules of that class are applied to the div element, 
          in which case the div begins animating in a continuous cycle, 
          until the checkbox is unchecked (and the class thus again updated).

      <h2>CSS3 Transforms</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Designing, Defining, and Triggering CSS3 Transforms without Custom Libraries</h3>
        <p>
          transform is a property in CSS3 that allows you to manipulate the 
          shape, size, and position of an html element. For example, 
          with transform you can translate an element's position, meaning that 
          you move it up or down and left or right from its existing position. 
          Another example is rotate, which allows you to rotate an element 
          by a number of degrees. You can also scale an element, making it 
          larger or smaller than its original size, by multiplying its width and height.
          Another transformation is skew, which takes a rectangle shaped element 
          and makes it into a non-square parallelogram. There is also a 
          matrix method that allows a combination of the above in a single concise statement.

      <h2>CSS3 Transitions</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Designing, Defining, and Triggering CSS3 Transitions without Custom Libraries</h3>
        <p>
          With transitions, you can gradually change a set of css properties and 
          specify the amount of time it takes 
          for the change to take effect, giving a smooth 
          transition from one set of rules to another. The rate of 
          transition can also be adjusted, being either linear (meaning that 
          the transition happens at a constant rate), or eased in to/ out of 
          (meaning that the transition begins/ends slowly but speeds up mid transition). 
          Typically, transitions occur on some trigger, for example on 
          mouse hover, or when javascript updates a css class/ property on an element.

        <p>
          Animations are similar to transitions, but also have some unique features. With animations, 
          you can set the number of times they loop, or have them loop indefinitely. You also have 
          greater control over the checkpoints, or keyframes, between the start and end of the animation.

        <p>The canvas tag provides a special container that can be used by javascript for drawing images on the page via the canvas api. To use the tag, include height and width attributes, give it an id (so that your script knows which element to draw on), and end with a closing tag. In between the opening and closing tags should be any fallback content, in case the browser fails to load the content intended for the element. The content drawn in the container is defined by the functions declared in the javascript. </p>
